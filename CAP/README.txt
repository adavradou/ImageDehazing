This MATLAB code is an implementation of the single image dehazing 
algorithm proposed in the paper "A Fast Single Image Haze Removal 
Algorithm using Color Attenuation Prior" by Qingsong Zhu, Jiaming Mai 
and Ling Shao. 

***********************************************************************
The code can be run on MATLAB R2014a. Make sure your MATLAB has 
included guided filter proposed in "Guided Image Filtering" by Kaiming He,
Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang.

*******************************Note That*******************************

When you use our provided the source code, Please Cite Our Paper "A Fast Single Image Haze Removal 
Algorithm using Color Attenuation Prior, IEEE-TIP,2015" by Qingsong Zhu, Jiaming Mai and Ling Shao." 

The source code provided by us will not be used for any commercial purposes, ONLY for research purpose.


Intructions:
1) Put the hazy image into the directory "inputImgs"
2) Modify the image path at the begining of "runDehazing.m"
3) Run the "runDehazing.m" script in MATLAB

This is the version 1 of the distribution. For more questions, please 
feel free to cantact us.
